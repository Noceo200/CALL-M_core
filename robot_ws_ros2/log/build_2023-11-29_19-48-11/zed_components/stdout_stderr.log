  By not providing "Findnmea_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nmea_msgs" with

  Add the installation prefix of "nmea_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "nmea_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "nmea_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
